\subsection*{Introduction}

In this project, the problem of N identical point charges confined to free motion on the surface of a 
sphere is examined. Via a finite-difference approximation simulation, the dynamic behaviour of point 
charges each originating from random initial positions on the surface of the sphere is computed. 
Since like charges repel, if a velocity-dependent retarding force is present for each charge then it 
follows that all charges will eventually reach a stable equilibrium where the electrostatic potential
energy is minimized. 
 
Through examining the potential energy of these equilibrium configurations as well as conducting 
equivalence class analysis, the equilibrium configurations of the charges are cataloged and their
symmetry is characterized. The equilibrium configurations in this problem are described in detail 
in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_problem}{Thomson problem}.

In order to test the validity of the numerical model constructed for this problem, convergence testing 
is also applied. This is done by simulating an identical scenario using multiple discretization levels,
and analyzing the level-to-level differences. This convergence testing allows us to determine to which
order our finite difference approximation is accurate.
